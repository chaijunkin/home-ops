What I found
The ReplicationSource calibre-web-automated is stuck in status Synchronizing with Reason=SyncInProgress. (You already saw this.)
The volsync controller is repeatedly logging that a VolumeSnapshot is being deleted and it needs to wait:
log messages: "snap is being deleted-- need to wait" for snapshot volsync-calibre-web-automated-src.
The VolumeSnapshot volsync-calibre-web-automated-src has a DeletionTimestamp and a finalizer (snapshot.storage.kubernetes.io/volumesnapshot-bound-protection) so it is pending deletion.
The corresponding VolumeSnapshotContent snapcontent-ce8f167c-b4f7-47b1-ae35-02859572f3bc also has DeletionTimestamp and finalizer(s). Its status is empty (the CSI driver apparently has not completed/acknowledged the deletion).
Snapshot-controller logs show repeated snapshot content delete errors (some other snapshots mention "not found"), indicating snapshot-controller/CSI interactions had trouble finishing snapshot deletions for these local-hostpath snapshots.
While the snapshot content remains in the API with finalizers, volsync will hold the ReplicationSource in SyncInProgress (it waits for the VolumeSnapshot deletion to finish).
In short: volsync is blocked waiting for the snapshot and snapshotcontent to be fully deleted, but the snapshot-controller/CSI driver didn't finish removing the VolumeSnapshotContent finalizer — so the API objects are stuck and volsync won't proceed.

Safe next steps (what I recommend)
If you want volsync to continue ASAP, you can remove the snapshot finalizer(s) so the snapshot and its content are removed from the API. This is safe when:

The snapshot is no longer needed (looks like it was created earlier and is marked for deletion), and
You accept forcing the deletion of the VolumeSnapshot/VolumeSnapshotContent object in Kubernetes (this does not delete your PVC or PV).
Commands below will:

show the current snapshot/content (for confirmation),
remove the finalizers to allow deletion, and
confirm ReplicationSource status afterwards.
Run these (they work in fish; normal kubectl syntax):

Inspect the snapshot and content (confirm names and UIDs):
Remove finalizers from the VolumeSnapshot (this allows the snapshot object to be deleted):
Remove finalizers from the VolumeSnapshotContent (this allows the content object to be deleted):
Check the VolumeSnapshot / VolumeSnapshotContent are gone (or at least no deletionTimestamp/finalizers):
Re-check ReplicationSource status:
After you remove the blocking finalizers the snapshot/snapshotcontent should be deleted and volsync should be able to proceed (the ReplicationSource controller will create mover pods or continue the sync). Expect the Status condition "Synchronizing" to clear and lastSyncStartTime / latestMoverStatus to update once the controller resumes.

Extra diagnostics if you prefer to investigate first
If you'd rather not force-delete finalizers yet, gather these logs to see why the CSI driver didn't finish:

Snapshot-controller logs:
Democratic CSI node/controller pod logs (replace pod name if different):
Look for messages about failing to delete VolumeSnapshotContent or errors calling the CSI driver DeleteSnapshot (local-hostpath drivers sometimes don't support snapshot deletion or there can be a race/bug).

Notes, risks, and follow-ups
Removing finalizers is effectively forcing the Kubernetes API objects to be deleted. It does not touch your PVC data; it only clears the stuck snapshot metadata. Do not remove finalizers if you actually need the VolumeSnapshot for restores.
If you see repeated snapshot deletion failures across many snapshots, you should check the CSI driver (org.democratic-csi.local-hostpath) for a bug or version mismatch with the snapshot-controller — consider upgrading or checking driver logs.
If you want, I can:
run the exact patch commands for you now, or
collect the snapshot-controller + democratic-csi logs and summarize the exact CSI error messages before we remove finalizers. Tell me which you prefer and I'll proceed.
